![Personal preferences modal - theme](<../../.gitbook/assets/theme-modal.png>)

If you don't find the option "theme", verify in Live admin if the option `System & Display > User preferences > Theme customization` is activated. Please note that, if the "Language customization" toggle is also on, the option will be called "Personal preferences" instead of "Theme".

### Allow users to select their language
Live users can now choose their preferred language. To do so, the user needs to click on the top-right button and, them, choose "Language". The preferred language will be used in Live interface and received e-mails. Entities names (like dashboard names) will not be affected.

If you don't find the option "Language", verify in Live admin if the option System & Display > User preferences > Language customization is activated. Please note that, if the "Theme customization" toggle is also on, the option will be called "Personal preferences" instead of "Language".

### Allow users to sync personal preference options across devices
At "Personal preferences menu", the user can choose either to:
- **Use its language and theme preferences only in the current browser:** when choosing this option, the personal preferences will be saved at the browser local storage
- **Match preferences across devices/browser:** any other device/browser using the same Live account will receive the same preference configurations

<!-- {% hint style="info" %} -->
> Local preferences will always have priority over preferences saved across devices.
