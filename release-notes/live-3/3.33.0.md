### Allow users to sync personal preference options across devices
At "Personal preferences menu", the user can choose either to:
- **Use its language and theme preferences only in the current browser:** when choosing this option, the personal preferences will be saved at the browser local storage
- **Match preferences across devices/browser:** any other device/browser using the same Live account will receive the same preference configurations

Local preferences will always have priority over preferences saved across devices.
