# Data Purging

Live allows the administrators to configure **Storage Purge Rules** in order to delete data using time-based rules that doesn't need to be kept longer in the environment.

![Storage > Purge Rules enables the data purging for any event type in a time-based manner](<../.gitbook/assets/image (148).png>)

The administrator can **Simulate** the purge operation before to **Run** the purge in the environment.&#x20;

The **Save** button will keep the set of purge rules persisted but **no purge will be executed automatically**. Live **only purges data** when an administrator clicks on **Run purge** using the rules displayed in this screen.&#x20;

### System event types to purge

Most of event types starting with  `__` are system-wide and used internally or by Live or by some plugins in order to track the operations or to fulfill some monitoring dashboards (for example the default System Monitoring dashboard).

The **Storage > Stats** menu in administration page delivers a way to understand the size and how many events are persisted in the storage providers. That page delivers a toggle button to display the typical system events as following.

It's very important the administrator be aware which event types can be deleted and that decision will depend on each customer installation.

In general, environment administrators should periodically purge internal events to save storage resources. By default, it is suggested to **delete events older than a month**, but this decision is up to the environment administrator :

1. `__failed`: data not persisted into storage providers due any failure (you might want to keep a backup for them before purging).
2. `__queries`: data stats of all queries's lifecycle including warnings.
3. `__metrics`: contains platform metrics in general, including disk storage, CPU and memory, you might to keep them longer if you need wider spans in system monitoring dashboards.
4. `__log`: output generated by logging frameworks (only WARN/ERROR levels) and stored additionally as event type, probably the default log files in your installation already have that data persisted, so it's safe to delete them.
5. `__indexes`: covers the request for index operations (checking and creating) in Storage Providers by queries.
6. `__elements`: information about the status of elements, e.g. Dashboards, Extensions, Datasources, etc.
7. `__extensions`: contains status information from extensions (through live-api) and starting and error information of periodic queries.
8. `__audit`: contains monitoring information about the elements. e.g. Dashboard, Datasources, Widget, etc.

Below the example of how to configure expressions for collections that can be purged for period older than 3 months:
